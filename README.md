reactive-backbone
=================


Test environment for a complete front end application using:
- Backbone.js for models/collections/router
- React for views a.k.a components. 
- RequireJS for lazy loading scripts. 

As a start I will build a prototype for a pretty advanced filterable search component that will respons to changes in real-time.
The data source initially will be localstorage.


Filterable Search Component
===========================

The user will be able to search for places using this component.
I've identified this component structure.

- FilterablePlacesBox
  - SearchInput
  - AdvancedSearchBox
  - PlacesList
    - ListTools
      - ListCounter
      - ListPager
    - PlacesRows
      - PlaceRow
    - ListTools
      - ListCounter
      - ListPager
